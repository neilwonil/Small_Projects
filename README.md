# Small_Projects

I've created this repository to share the projects I've completed from one of the Udemy courses, "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp," which was created by Dr. Angela Yu.

You can find the course here: https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/

Each file in the repository contains a different project from the course.
